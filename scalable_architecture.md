## Scalable Architecture
The first step to alleviating any problem – in software or otherwise – is to clearly and accurately define what the problem actually is.

> A Problem Well Stated is a Problem Half-solved. ~ Charles Kettering

Once you’ve got a much better sense of what the problem is, you should start to tackle it by trying the simplest solution that directly addresses the issues – remember, we’re always trying to avoid adding unnecessary complexity.

Also the Perfect Architecture is a Myth because Evolution cannot be predicted. The users will always be able to surprise us.
